Xmas field of trees.

A short program that generates a field with a random numbers of pretty trees, just like this one:
   ^
  ^ ^
 (o  )
(o  o )
   U

The field is delimited with the symbol `#`.
The program handles perspective, showing trees "at the bottom" in front of the other trees.

# have same surface then only one tree can fit, if the field surface is twice the tree surface
# then two trees can fit.
# You can tweak this maximum number with the occupation rate, e.g. by setting it to 0.5 you only
# allow half the surface to be covered.
# However, they will be planted randomly, so even with an occupation rate lower than 1, trees
# might overlap. Nevertheless it helps limiting the number of trees, that we allow to plant.
